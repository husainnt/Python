#futher examples on lists
#reversing a list, using listname.reverse()
cars=['bmw','audi','toyota','subaru']
cars.reverse() #reverses the order of the list
#reverse() doesnâ€™t sort backward alphabetically; it simply reverses the order of the list
print(cars)
#finding length of a list using len(list_name)
print(len(cars)) #Note that indexing of a list is from 0, however counting/length is from 1
